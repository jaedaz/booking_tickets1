        Thelma is a 2024 American comedy-drama film written, directed, and edited by Josh Margolin.
        The film stars June Squibb as Thelma Post,
        a 93-year-old woman who becomes the victim of a phone scam and embarks on a determined quest to reclaim what was taken from her.
        She is joined by her grandson, Daniel (Fred Hechinger), and her friend, portrayed by Richard Roundtree in his final film role.
        The cast also includes Clark Gregg, Parker Posey, and Malcolm McDowell.
        The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2024, and was released theatrically in the United States by Magnolia Pictures on June 21, 2024.
        It has received positive reviews for its heartwarming narrative and performances,
        particularly that of June Squibb, who performed most of her own stunts in the film.
